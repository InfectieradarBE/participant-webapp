With the data that we receive from our participants every week, we can map the spread of flu, COVID-19, other infections and health complaints.
We thank the participants for their weekly contributions. Together we can map out the situation in Belgium quickly and at an early stage.

## Symptoms and health complaints
Our participants report every week whether they had one or more symptoms.
In the past week we received 711 completed questionnaires. No symptoms were reported in 87.6% of the completed questionnaires.
This graph shows the percentage of participants reporting a specific symptom. A combination of symptoms may indicate a specific infectious disease such as flu, COVID-19, RSV, or others.
