**Why do we conduct the study?**

Human interactions are strongly associated with the spread of viral respiratory infections, making the study of social contact patterns crucial for effective public health interventions. In this study, we aim to characterize transmission routes of respiratory diseases in a university setting, by mapping social interactions occurring at the Data Science Institute (DSI), Hasselt University, Belgium. Over a two-week period, we will collect data using close-proximity sensors and a contact diary to quantify contact interactions that occur during a working day among DSI and non-DSI members during meetings, teaching activities and other university events . These data will be used to construct time-resolved contact networks describing contact interactions in a university setting, and develop contact-based epidemiological models for the spread of respiratory infections. Simulation studies will further be conducted to evaluate the influence of changes in contact patterns, e.g., teleworking, on spreading dynamics


**Who can take part?**

All members of the Data Science Institute (DSI) are eligible to participate in the study.


**How does the study work?**

Upon enrolment, each participant will be asked to fill out an intake questionnaire (“Enrollment Questionnaire”) to provide basic information. Each participant will then be given a wearable proximity sensor to wear each day from the time they enter the university until they leave. Upon leaving, the sensor will be removed and placed in the personal drawer, or in another safe place. Additionally, participants will need to complete a “Study Diary” at the end of each day, recording any social contacts made with DSI members that may not have been captured by the sensor (i.e., when the sensor was not yet worn, or had been removed) or made with non-DSI members, and any in-person meeting, teaching activities or other academic events.


**Data**

During the enrollment basic demographic information (i.e., age, sex, nationality), sensor identification number and professional role within DSI will be asked. Through a diary-based survey and close-proximity sensors, data on social interactions, including in-person meetings, teaching activities and other academic events,  will be collected throughout the study days. 

The data obtained in this study will be processed by the research team solely for the purposes of the study, and data analysis will be conducted using pseudonymized data. Participants may withdraw from the study at any time without providing a reason. Under no circumstances will the data collected be used to evaluate participants' professional performance or to assess personal breaks or needs.The data will be processed in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations and with full respect for your rights and in particular your privacy.


**Taking part**
Your participation in this study is voluntary and you can withdraw from the study at any time without giving a reason.  
We do not expect any risks or disadvantages from participating in this study.

The study is coordinated by the Data Science Institute (DSI) and has been evaluated by the Social and Societal Ethics Committee (SMEC) at UHasselt. The fact that it has been funded and approved does not mean that you should feel obliged to participate.

### 1. Why are we carrying out this study?

Human interactions are strongly associated with the spread of viral respiratory infections, making the study of social contact patterns crucial for effective public health interventions. This study aims to characterise social interactions at the Data Science Institute (DSI) at Hasselt University, Belgium, by mapping the transmission routes of respiratory diseases within a university setting. Over a two-week period, we will collect data on social interactions through close-proximity sensors to track in-person interactions and contact diaries to record interactions outside the DSI. This information will be used to **develop time-resolved networks** that estimate contact frequency and duration, which will **inform contact-based epidemiological models** for the spread of respiratory infections. Furthermore, simulation studies will assess spatio-temporal transmission patterns and the effectiveness of interventions such as teleworking.


### 2. Who can participate in this study?

All members of the Data Science Institute (DSI) are eligible to participate in the study


### 3. Do I have to participate in this study? 

Your participation in the study is voluntary and should never take place under pressure. This means that you have the right not to participate in the study. You may also withdraw at any time without having to give a reason, even though you previously agreed to participate.


### 4. What will happen during the study?
During the study, participants will first be asked to complete an intake questionnaire ("Enrollment Questionnaire") to gather basic personal information. Each participant will receive a wearable proximity sensor, which must be worn from the moment they enter the university campus until they leave. Upon leaving the university, participants should remove the sensor and store it in their assigned drawer for safekeeping. At the end of each day, participants will record their social interactions in a "Study Diary" on the infectieradar.be platform, particularly focusing on any in-person meetings or contacts with DSI members that might not have been captured by the sensor (such as when the sensor wasn't yet worn or had been removed) or interactions with non-DSI members, and any in-person meeting, teaching activities or other academic events.
