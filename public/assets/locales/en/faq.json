    {
      "title": "Why do we need you?",
      "content": "Your unique social interactions are part of a bigger picture that helps us understand how respiratory diseases spread. Social contacts are diverse and shaped by factors like e.g. location, which play a key role in transmission patterns. Together, we can better understand how our interactions affect disease spread, helping us build strategies to keep our communities safe and healthy!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Why should I join, and especially how does it help if all my DSI colleagues join too?",
      "content": "Each person who joins makes a real impact! The more DSI members participate, the better our study can capture the full network of our interactions. Together, we’ll build a richer, more accurate model that reflects transmission routes of respiratory diseases within DSI—your contribution truly matters!"
    },
    {
      "title": "How can you help?",
      "content": "Joining us is easy! Just fill out a quick intake form, wear a small wearable close-proximity sensor during your day on campus, and store it in your drawer before leaving the office. At the end of each working day, fill out a quick survey collecting information on interactions the sensor might miss. That’s it! You have helped us to complete our social network picture!"
    },
    {
      "title": "What’s this cool gadget called a wearable close-proximity sensor?",
      "content": "Think of it as your little tech buddy! These wearable sensors track how close you are to others, helping us to gather data on social interactions in real-time while keeping everything super safe and low-power. They use low-energy radio signals to measure proximity, so you can feel good knowing they’re much less powerful than your mobile phone or Wi-Fi. Plus, they help us gather valuable data to improve public health strategies!"
    },
    {
      "title": "Exciting!!! When does it all begin?",
      "content": "We’re excited to kick off the study on December 2nd after which it will run until December 13th, 2024! During this time, we’ll work together to gather insights that could make a real difference."
    },
    {
      "title": "What if I’m off on an adventure during (some of) the study period?",
      "content": "No worries at all! You can still be a valuable part of our study. If you happen to be away for any reason—be it a vacation, conference, or business trip—just make sure to fill in your contact diary at the end of each day you’re away. If you know you’ll be away before the study ends, feel free to return the sensor earlier to one of our team members (Neilshan Loedy - E129). Your contributions still matter!"
    },
    {
      "title": "You are not the two full weeks at the campus?",
      "content": "No problem at all! The study and the survey are constructed in such a way that you can still contribute when working from home, having meetings in other locations or even begin abroad. You just report this in the daily survey, and by doing so, you’ll help us gather a wealth of important information!"
    },
    {
      "title": "What’s next?",
      "content": "Yes! This is a pilot study, paving the way for future research in vulnerable populations where controlling spread of respiratory infections is crucial. We’re already planning the next steps and hope to learn from this pilot, gaining insights that will shape strategies to protect those most at risk."
    },
    {
      "title": "What makes certain environments so important for contact studies?",
      "content": "Have you ever thought about how our interactions are related to the location where these take place? Traditional mathematical models often assume that everyone interacts equally, but our real-life connections are far more nuanced! Cosy homes have close, frequent and long-lasting contacts, while busy universities feature a vibrant mix of shorter interactions. By studying these unique environments, we can create tailored models that accurately reflect disease transmission in specific epidemiological settings."
    },
    {
      "title": "Why is the university setting a perfect place for this study?",
      "content": "Universities are like miniature societies, bustling with distinct groups—professors, PhD students, and undergraduates—each engaging in various settings like classrooms, labs, and social spaces. This diversity creates intricate networks of contacts that reveal how diseases can spread within different segments of the same community. By diving into these interactions, we can gather valuable insights that benefit both the university and similar environments."
    },
    {
      "title": "Where does all this data go, and why does it matter?",
      "content": "We’ll use this data to build detailed “maps” of interactions within our university, creating time-sensitive contact networks. These networks will help us develop models to better understand and predict how respiratory infections spread in similar settings."
    },
    {
      "title": "How can I step up and contribute?",
      "content": "We’d love for all members of the Data Science Institute (DSI) to be part of this study! Your participation is completely voluntary, and you’re free to step back at any time, no questions asked. By joining, you’ll be helping us unlock valuable insights."
    },
    {
      "title": "Oops! What if I forget to write down my social interactions in the diary?",
      "content": "We totally understand that life can be busy! While we recommend completing your contact diary at the end of each day, you can fill it out whenever it’s most convenient for you. Just make sure to capture important interactions—every entry helps us paint a clearer picture!"
